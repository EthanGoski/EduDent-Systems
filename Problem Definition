Project Title:

UofR Campus Dentist Management System

Problem Definition:

The University of Regina Campus Dentist Clinic is dedicated to providing high-quality dental care to students, faculty, and staff. 

However, the clinic faces challenges in managing patient records, appointment scheduling, billing, and inventory management. 

These challenges result in increased administrative workload, longer wait times for patients, and potential errors in record-keeping. 

Our task is to solve this efficiently by building a software application using Java Programming Language.
