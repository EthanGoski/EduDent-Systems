This is our second solution, it is a high fidelity prototype that allows us to visualize and use some of the features we envisioned.
This solution contains some coloring options and some basic feature usage. However, this solution is not linked to any databasing
so anything we do is limited to the file/figma itself. We can use the key points of this solution to spring board into a final solution
where we will decide on colors and fully flesh out features and how the application will react with these features.
