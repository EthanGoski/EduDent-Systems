This was our initial solution, we chose to do a low fidelity prototype to ensure that we knew which main portions we wanted. However, we did not choose this to be our final design as it lacked enough depth to be usable for an entire dentist office and was more like a singular dentist's office. As such, we knew that we needed to add more to it, such as specific colors, better UI, more usability for dentists and patients and some other not as important features.
