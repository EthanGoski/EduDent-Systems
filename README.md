# 1 Introduction

The Campus Dental Clinic at the University of Regina faces many problems including managing patient records, making appointments, billing, and maintaining inventory. As a result, this poses a burden on administration leading to longer waiting times for patients as well as mistakes in record-keeping. In response to this problem, we developed a full-fledged software application using Java Programming Language that is aimed at automating and streamlining all activities of the clinic.

The proposed dental clinic management system has been designed to provide an integrated solution which can handle different aspects of the clinic's operations. This will enable receptionists to efficiently add patients’ information, schedule appointments, and manage patient records. Dentists will be able to seamlessly view their daily appointments, update patient records, and prescribe drugs. Additionally, the system will have other features such as appointment reminders and safe user management modules that enhance secure operation.

In sections following this one, we present detailed descriptions of the design requirements of this system, implementation details used, testing strategies applied, and future work. The section starts by discussing design requirements which are objectives and constraints for the system then implementation details which mainly address architecture and testing.

# System Testing

System Testing was done on the entire Dental Clinic Management System. To accomplish this, we extracted a Finite State Machine and used node coverage, a form of graph coverage, to test it. We did not use logic coverage since we did not have hardcoded predicates to guard the transition between states. If we did have predicates dictating the transition in our code, we would have used logic coverage.

## Finite State Machine

    EnterPatientDetails --> CheckPatientExists: Check if patient exists
    CheckPatientExists --> UpdatePatientInfo: Update patient info if exists

## ECLIPSE Test Cases & Test Coverages
Now that we have all the theoritical components and the diagrams in place, it is time to check our tests on Eclispse, which the whole point of our project.

### JUnit test 
The JUnit test for our test folder in the project shows that we have 71 tests that run wih no errors or failures.

<img width="1250" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-22 at 4 39 49 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a171c7c5-6fb9-4f29-9cc1-93ebef2b1e12">

### Test Coverage
The test coverage is arguably the most important part of testing our code for the project. Below you can see that we achieved a 100% test coverage on most files. You can also check each percentage for each file in the folder called `Test Coverage` in this repository.

![888A3838-A16E-40D7-B9D2-9E986AD918C6_share](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f52509a-86bc-42dd-9a57-2874b2b7a06d)

- **User.java Test Coverage (80%)**
  - The test coverage for `User.java` reached 80%.
  - This was because the tests included checks for passwords, which are hardcoded.
  - Testing password-related functionality was deemed unnecessary since we are not connected to a backend database like MySQL.

- **Appointment.java Test Coverage (98.6%)**
  - The test coverage for `Appointment.java` achieved 98.6%.
  - We did not achieve 100% coverage due to the nature of a function within the class. This function compares two appointments and returns    true if they are identical or false if they are different. It also checks if any individual components within each appointment are the      same. However, since the initial comparison often returns true, the checks for individual components do not proceed further.

- **Main Method Test Coverage (0%)**
  - We did not test the main method as it is uncommon and unnecessary.
  - Consequently, the main method shows 0% coverage.

- **Overall Test Coverage (99.1%)**
  - Despite the above points, we reached an overall test coverage of 99.1% for our test cases.

#### 3.3.5 Limitations
Despite its strengths, the solution has some limitations:

- **Scalability**: While designed to be scalable, the current implementation may face performance issues with a significantly large user base.
- **User Training**: very simple training is required for users to fully utilize the system’s capabilities.
- **Integration**: Limited integration with other third-party healthcare systems, which could restrict interoperability, especially if our plan was to be used for the university, we would connect a large database with thousand of students, which could be a potential problem.

# 6 Conclusion and Future Work

## Conclusion

In this project, we successfully designed and implemented the Dental Clinic Management System, meeting the project's functional and non-functional requirements. The key achievements include:
1. Efficiently scheduling appointments for patients with dentists.
2. Managing basic patient records, including personal information and contact details.
3. User login functionality for doctors and receptionists.
4. Allowing doctors to assign and manage patient prescriptions.
5. Enabling doctors to view their scheduled appointments for the day.
6. Allowing receptionists to add, edit, and delete patient information.
7. Storing data securely in a file-based system.

By achieving these objectives, we satisfied the constraints of security, scalability, reliability, and user-friendliness.
